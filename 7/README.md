This is a CLA that calculates the maximum number of candies you can get by optimally smashing pinatas.

*How to compile and run:*
- Compile the program using a C++ compiler(for example g++):
g++ main.cpp -o program_name
program_name.exe

*After launching, the program expects input in the following format:*
The number of pinatas.
The value of each pinata (positive integers).

*Notes:*
The program uses memoization (top-down DP) to handle large inputs efficiently.

I spent about 4.5 hours on this task
